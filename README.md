# SYDE675

The code in the file SYDE_Project.ipynb is built to be run in Google Colab. It should be able to run with out of the box with the attached 'Image.zip' file containing a few images of interest. 

To change the image that is being looked at, please change the variable "path", located in cell 3. The available options would be the image names within the zip file.



All files in the folder "paper-of-interest" are relavant to the paper "Learning to Count Everything". The exemplar code can be run by using the demo.py model. 

A few example outputs can be found in "paper-of-interest/outputs". 
A few example inputs can be found in "paper-of-interest/FSC147_384_V2"
A video demonstration of the code running can be found at the following YouTube link: https://youtu.be/zjbV-lh7Zs4
